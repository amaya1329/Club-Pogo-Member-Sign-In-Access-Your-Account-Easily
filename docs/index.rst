Security and Account Safety
===========================

When signing into your Club Pogo account, security should always be a priority. Here are some steps you can take to ensure that your account remains secure:

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   To further protect your account, consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA). This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to verify your identity with a second method, such as a code sent to your phone.

3. **Keep Your Email Address Up to Date**
   Make sure that the email address associated with your Club Pogo account is current. This ensures that you can receive important account updates and password recovery emails.
